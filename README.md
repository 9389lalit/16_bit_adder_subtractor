# Adder 
To use the circuit as a adder give the adder/subtractor pin value as 0 and as we know the xor of 0 and any number is the number itself so we will get the number B itself and also the cin is 0 so after adding the bits you can see the output in the 7 segment displays.
In case of overflow  you can see the extra cassy bit as high.

# Subtractor 
To use the circuit as a subtractor use adder/subtractor pin as 1 and 1^B=B' and cin=1 so after addition we will get the subtraction but as if the carry is high then the answer will remain the same but in case of carry bit as 0 we will again change the number in 
2's complement

You can see the final output at 7 segment displays
